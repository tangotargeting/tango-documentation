Each campaign is composed of \na message\n, \na set of actions\n, \na set of rules\n for presenting the message \nand useful insights\n based on the aggregated user actions data.\n\n\nThe message\n\n\nProbably the most important part of a campaign is the message it sends to the users. This message is responsible, in most cases, for convincing the user to take action. Here are a few examples of messages that can be presented to the users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, there is a minimum required for each message and it can be implemented in a matter of seconds. However as previously stated, this is what your users will see, so we recommend investing some time in writing a good message. You can also checkout our [[Guide for writing impactful campaigns]].\n\n\nBelow are the elements of which a message is composed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle*\n\n\nA short title for your message. Maximum of 30 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody\n\n\nYour actual message. Up to 110 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Action*\n\n\nA button with an associated action (open a link, make a call, etc.) that the user is expected to take.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Action\n\n\nA secondary action the user is expected to take.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nAn image to enhance the power of the message. At least .png, .jpg, .gif supported. The height can vary to some extent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose*\n\n\nProvided by default. It is not considered a user action but rather a dismiss event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe elements marked with asterisk(*) are mandatory.\n\n\nActions\n\n\nSimply put, an action is what happens when the user taps or clicks a button that comes with a message. For instance, a campaign may be giving away a 30% discount for books bought on Amazon. Naturally, the primary action in this case, should take you to a web page were the user can view the discount code. The image below demonstrates how such an action can be created.\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in the image, there are several types of actions you can add to a message. All action types, except \nCUSTOM\n work out of the box. Here is what each of the does:\n\n\n\n\nURL\n - opens a web page in your default browser at the specified link\n\n\nCALL\n - opens the phone application with the specified number filled\n\n\nTEXT\n - opens the messaging application with the number filled (if provided)\n\n\nAPP\n - attempts to launch the application with the specified identifier (bundleId or package name)\n\n\nEMAIL\n - prepares an email in your email application with the specified email filled\n\n\nCUSTOM\n - custom actions that are handled at development time\n\n\n\n\nNote that sometimes there are more applications that can perform a specific task. For instance you may have several browsers installed on your device. If the user doesn't have one set as default, the device may present a list of browsers to choose from, when initiating an URL action. \n\n\nRules\n\n\nEvery campaign comes with a set of rules. Some rules represent limitations, such as the number of times a message can be displayed. Others describe filters, such as audiences or applications.

The goal of the campaign is to send a real time message (push notification) to all users to inform them about this special offer and allow them to quickly book flights.\n\n\nTo create a campaign the \nCampaigns\n tab in the left side menu must be selected. Once we are there we will press the blue button in the top right corner labeled \nNew Campaign\n.\n\n\nEnter your account\n\n\nIf you don't have an account yet, create one by starting a demo at \nthis URL\n. Then, to be able to test the campaigns, please install the \nAndroid\n or \niOS\n app on your phone and scan the QR code from your Tango account.\n\n\nType\n\n\nThe first step in creating a campaign is to determine its type. In the image below is represented what we see in the Tango Console. \n\n\n\n\nFollowing this section are details for each campaign type. For this scenario we will create a \nScheduled Campaign\n which is at the top of the list.\n\n\nDetails\n\n\nThe next thing we'll see is a screen were we will add some details about our campaign.\n\n\n\n\nApart from specifying the campaign name, this step is the only one that differs for each campaign type. Every campaign must have a name for easy identification. Thus, the name must be unique. We will call ours \n5\nth\n Anniversary Celebration Discount\n. \n\n\nWe chose to create a scheduled campaign, but now we are given three options. We said we want to send the our offer in real time, meaning we want a push notification, so we will choose to \nSend immediately\n. For more on real-time campaigns check [[Real-time]] campaigns page. The other two options are discussed in [[Specific dates]]  campaigns and [[Recurrent]] campaigns.\n\n\nContent (The Message)\n\n\nScrolling down and clicking the \nContinue\n button will take us to the screen where we will build the content presented to the user when the notification is received.\n\n\n\n\nLet's add a title the title \"Celebrate Penguin Airlines\" and a body that describes the offer. Also, we must add the primary action. In our case it will take the user to the home page of Penguin Airlines website where the user can start booking flights and find additional information about the offer. We could add a secondary action that could open another web page with other ways to benefit of the offer, like becoming a member.\n\n\nIt is also a good idea to add an image with the company logo (maybe with some fireworks in this case) for a stronger impact on the user. \n\n\nNow that we have our content built, lets move to the next step.\n\n\nSpecifics\n\n\n\n\nHere we have some rules for displaying the message, such as how many devices should receive the message or the maximum displays for each device, etc. Most probably, we will rarely use these rules but it is good to know them if we have some limitations for our campaign. For instance, if we had only 1000 discounts available, we could set the \nDevice limit\n to 1000.\n\n\nWe are happy with the default values as we want our campaign to reach as many customers as possible, so we will simply move on to the next step.\n\n\nAudience\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost done. Before sending the campaign we have to decide who should receive it. First of all, we may have several applications added to our account. We will choose the ones that are of interest to us. \n\n\nAfter selecting the the apps, we can filter further by adding tags. Tags are some strings defining a certain group of users (e.g.: \"student\", \"shopper\", etc.). We will ignore tags for now, but more information about them is in section [[What is a segment?]].\n\n\nFurther below are other filters that may e handy to us. For instance, we may want to send the campaign to LG devices only, for that we can check the name of the device in the \nName\n dropdown field. \n\n\nNote that only the filters that have actual data on the server will be displayed, for example if no iPhone device have yet used our app then no iPhone data will reach Tango servers and \niPhone\n will not appear in the \nName\n filter.\n\n\nGetting back to our scenario, lets suppose we don't want to filter anything, so wi will continue with finishing the creating our campaign. We'll hit \nContinue\n and see a screen with the overview of our campaign. If we missed something or want to make changes to the campaign we can do that by pressing the \nEdit\n button. Otherwise we will continue with submitting the campaign.\n\n\n\n\nSend/Activate\n\n\nOnce we have finished and submitted our campaign we will see it at the top of the campaigns list under \nDrafts\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor real-time campaigns we have the \"SEND NOW\" option. All the other campaigns have \"ACTIVATE\". The difference is that real-time campaigns are pushed immediately to all devices, whilst the others reach the devices when the devices are ready to synchronize with the server data. The latter ensures that all matching devices will receive the campaign.\n\n\nPressing \"SEND NOW\" will open a confirmation dialog which also informs us about the number of targeted devices and the option to \"PROCEED\" or \"POSTPONE\". When we are sure we want to send it we will hit \"PROCEED\". The next thing we would most likely want to do is to see the impact our campaign had: how many devices where reached, how many users saw the message and how many started booking a flight, etc. This information is available when clicking the the campaign in the \nIn Progress\n campaign list.\n\n\n\n\nMore information about campaign insights is covered in the [[Insights]] section.\n\n\nWe are done.",

Then simply choose \nLocation campaign\n.\n\n\nIn step 2, specify the start and end date.\n\n\n\n\nFurther below is a Google map on which the points of interest(locations) should be specified. A location is a blue filled circle with an additional surrounding circle defining the range of the active zone. Additionally, you can use the search bar if you can't find a place on the map.\n\n\n\n\nBelow the map is the list of all selected locations. On the right side for each item you can choose one of the three events that will trigger the campaign: \nENTER\n, \nLEAVE\n, \nSTAY\n. When choosing \nSTAY\n you will also have to specify the amount of time needed to pass after the ENTER event was triggered. We recommend choosing at least 1 minute, otherwise it doesn't differ too much from an ENTER trigger.\n\n\n\n\nOn the far left, each item has a spinner which specifies the range of the location. The location precision may vary from a device to another. Hence, it is a good idea to have some extra meters for better coverage.\n\n\nThe location list can be saved for later uses. Give it a descriptive name and load it the next time you intend to use it in a location campaign.",

For instance, imagine a photo gallery application for which you want a campaign triggered after every ten viewed photos. None of the other campaigns apply for this case. To solve this we have created Automated Campaigns. Basically, an Automated Campaign comes with predefined trigger(which is a string), used to trigger the campaign whenever desired. \n\n\nTo start creating an automated campaign go to your Tango account and select the Campaigns tab in the left side menu. Press on New Campaign and select a platform you want to create the campaign for. Then simply choose Automated Campaign.

As a shoes retailer, you may want to present some offers when someone searched for \"men's shoes\" or \"women's shoes\".

Further on, specify the keywords that will trigger the campaign. The rules for keywords are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n+positive keywords\n - must be inputed with a leading \"+\" sign and represent keywords that must appear in the search phrase. Example: for the \n+men's\n keyword the search phrase \"men's shoes\" will match, whereas \"women's shoes\" will fail;\n\n\n-negative keywords\n - must be inputed with a leading \"-\" sign and represent keywords that must not be present in the search.
